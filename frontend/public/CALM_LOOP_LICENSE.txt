This audio file was generated programmatically by the project script:
  scripts/generate_calm_loop.js

License / usage note:
- This file was synthesized by the project for development and MVP use.
- You may use it in this project for testing and local/demo purposes without additional licensing.
- For production and distribution (App Stores, public websites), we strongly recommend replacing this file
  with a professionally produced, royalty-free, and clearly licensed audio asset (commercial license).

Sources & best practice:
- Use royalty-free libraries or custom AI generation with a commercial license.
- Avoid using audio directly copied from YouTube or sources without explicit commercial rights.

If you want, I can help prepare alternate soundscapes or generate variants (Forest, Rain, Night Silence) similarly.
